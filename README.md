# Predicting-Heart-Disease-using-Machine-Learning
This project is an end-to-end machine learning pipeline to predict the presence of heart disease in patients based on medical attributes. The goal is to use classification algorithms to build a predictive model and evaluate its performance using appropriate metrics.

## 🎯 Objective
To build a machine learning model that can classify whether a patient has heart disease (`1`) or not (`0`) based on features such as:
- Age
- Sex
- Chest Pain Type
- Resting Blood Pressure
- Cholesterol
- Fasting Blood Sugar
- Resting ECG
- Max Heart Rate Achieved
- Exercise-Induced Angina
- ST Depression, etc.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
4. **Feature Engineering**
5. **Model Training (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)**
6. **Hyperparameter Tuning**
7. **Model Evaluation**
8. **Saving and Loading the Model**
